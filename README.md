# OAuth Standard

View the nuget package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OAuthStandard/1.0.0)

This is the code from [the original OAuth1.0a .NET library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OAuth/) converted to .NET Standard.

I downloaded the Nuget package, disassembled it, and rebuilt it in .NET Standard so people could continue using it.

Thanks to [conatuscreative](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/conatuscreative) for creating this package under the public domain. That was a nice thing to do. I will release this as a nuget package myself very soon.
